            Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and
            are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to
            match the React elements.

            Don't confuse Elements with Components. Components are made up of
            Elements and sometimes of other Components too.

            Once you create an element, you canâ€™t change its children or
            attributes. The way to make changes in a React application is by
            updating state.
