          <Text>
            After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript
            function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

          <Text>
            This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for
            loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it
            from functions:

          <SubTitle>JSX Prevents Injection Attacks</SubTitle>
          <Text>
            It is safe to embed user input in JSX. By default, React DOM escapes
            any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures
            that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in
            your application.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This
            helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.
